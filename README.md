# Kickstarter

Predict which projects will get funded

## Problem statement

Based on historical campaigns, predict which projects will get funded.

## Method

Regularized linear regression

## Files and folders

`kickstarter.ipynb` contains the solution.

`TODO` contains my thoughts on what to do next in order to move the project foward.

`notes` is a random collection of ideas etc that might be useful.

`html-output` is the jupyter notebook exported.

## Status 

I have barely begun working.
